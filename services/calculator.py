"""
Calculates the cost for the original market allocation of a demand, considering 
the current prices. Currently, supports the on-demand, all upfront reserve, partial
upfront reverve, no upfront reserve, all upfront savings plan, partial upfront savings
plan and no upfront savings plan markets.

Assumptions:
 - The cost of the reserves after the end time is not considered in the total cost
 - All markets have the same instance types
